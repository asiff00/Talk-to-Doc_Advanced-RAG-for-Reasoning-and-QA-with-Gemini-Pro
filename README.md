## What's Happening Behind the Scenes?

- **Chunking:** Your PDF is divided into smaller sections for better analysis, using LangChain's text splitting capabilities to manage the document's content efficiently.
- **Embedding with Gemini:** Each section is then given a unique embedding, using the 'GeminiEmbeddingFunction', which helps in understanding the content better for retrieval.
- **Storing and Searching in ChromaDB:** These embeddings are stored in ChromaDB, allowing for fast and accurate retrieval of information related to your questions.
- **Query Expansion:** To enhance the search, your query is expanded using the 'models/text-bison-001' model. This helps in considering various ways the question might be asked or phrased.
- **Cross Encoder Re-ranking:** The potential answers are then re-ranked for relevance using the 'cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2' model, ensuring that the most pertinent information is selected.
- **Final Response Generation:** The final answer is generated by the 'gemini-pro' model, which synthesizes the information into a clear and concise response.
