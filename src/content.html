    <h2>What's Happening Behind the Scenes?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chunking:</strong> Your PDF is divided into smaller sections for better analysis, using LangChain's
            text splitting capabilities to manage the document's content efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedding with Gemini:</strong> Each section is then given a unique embedding, using the
            'GeminiEmbeddingFunction', which helps in understanding the content better for retrieval.</li>
        <li><strong>Storing and Searching in ChromaDB:</strong> These embeddings are stored in ChromaDB, allowing for
            fast and accurate retrieval of information related to your questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Query Expansion:</strong> To enhance the search, your query is expanded using the
            'models/text-bison-001' model. This helps in considering various ways the question might be asked or
            phrased.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross Encoder Re-ranking:</strong> The potential answers are then re-ranked for relevance using the
            'cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2' model, ensuring that the most pertinent information is selected.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Response Generation:</strong> The final answer is generated by the 'gemini-pro' model, which
            synthesizes the information into a clear and concise response.</li>
    </ul>
